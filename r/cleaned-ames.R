# ---------------- Summary of work done in this code ----------------------

# Factors with known values from the data description were replaced.
# That leaves us with lotfrontage, garage year built, masonry veneer/area and electrical
# Its probably best to replace NA's with 0 for lotfrontage, assuming the property is not
# connected to a street. We might want to create new variables to describe the garage and
# I replaced masonry veneer type with no veneer and masonry area with 0, the respective
# mode and median. The final cleaned dataset is named "ames"
