# ---------------- Summary of work done in this code ----------------------

# Factors with known values from the data description were replaced.
# That leaves us with lotfrontage, garage year built, masonry veneer/area and electrical
# Its probably best to replace NA's with 0 for lotfrontage, assuming the property is not
# connected to a street. We might want to create new variables to describe the garage and
# I replaced masonry veneer type with no veneer and masonry area with 0, the respective
# mode and median. The final cleaned dataset is named "ames"

# this assumes there is a data folder in the parent folder of your working directory
# ask thanh about naming and location conventions

# some basement qualities actually have NA's

# We  have a quantitative variable (year) but 81 houses do not have garages
# What to do with NA's? I'm going to turn garageyrblt into a categorical variable
# to capture the age-related information while allowing us to account for no garage
# I will just bin the ages by quartile and replace NA's with 'nogar'

# this code replaces veneer type with the mode (none) and veneer area with 0

# The above code does it's best to retain as much information as possible from the original
# dataset. Now we can focus on feature engineering, dimension reduction, or simply fitting models
# We will probably need to wrap this code up in a function and apply it to the test dataframe
